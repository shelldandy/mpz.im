## So Spotify Web Looks Sweet

I really loved its new play button click situation so i decided to take a peak that their CSS code and snatched this bezier I shall save for future reference obviously:

```css
cubic-bezier(0,0,0,2.41)
```

Here's a gif just in case the UI changes later on or you haven't seen what I'm talking about
